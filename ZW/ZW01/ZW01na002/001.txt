ZW01na002_p0005a02║卷首語
ZW01na002_p0005a03║
ZW01na002_p0005a04║《藏外佛教文獻》每輯的卷首語為聯繫編者與讀者的橋樑與
ZW01na002_p0005a05║介紹本輯主要內容的園地。
ZW01na002_p0005a06║首先談一下什麼叫「藏外佛教文獻」？
ZW01na002_p0005a07║「藏」，指佛教大藏經。傳統所謂「大藏經」，專指漢文大藏
ZW01na002_p0005a08║經，包括正藏與續藏，它是我國漢文佛教典籍的總彙。我國的漢
ZW01na002_p0005a09║文大藏經種類雖多，仍有不少與佛教有關的文獻散佚在藏外。
ZW01na002_p0005a10║例如：近代以來從梵文、巴利語、藏文、蒙文等各種文字翻譯的佛
ZW01na002_p0005a11║教典籍；敦煌藏經洞保存的大量佛教典籍；各地圖書館、博物館
ZW01na002_p0005a12║保存的未為歷代大藏經所收的古代佛教典籍；正史、地方史志、
ZW01na002_p0005a13║叢書、類書、個人文集中保存的佛教資料；與佛教有關的金石資
ZW01na002_p0005a14║料；近現代的佛教著作與資料。上述種種均可稱為「藏外佛教文
ZW01na002_p0005a15║獻」。文獻是文化的主要載體之一，佛教文獻是佛教文化的主要
ZW01na002_p0005a16║載體之一。所以，已經入藏的典籍固然重要，散佚在藏外的文獻
ZW01na002_p0005a17║也不容忽視，必須認真加以整理。應該說明的是，歷代正藏，均
ZW01na002_p0005a18║經多次校勘，一般質量較高；而續藏所收典籍，往往有較大隨意
ZW01na002_p0005a19║性，且缺乏版本的精選與校勘，頗有文字錯訛等情。因此，有的
ZW01na002_p0005a20║典籍雖然已經為某續藏所收，但如果新發現的傳本比已入藏本
ZW01na002_p0005a21║更加完善，則也應該成為整理的對象。
ZW01na002_p0005a22║現在尚流傳於世界、且自成體系的佛教大藏經主要有三種：
ZW01na002_p0005a23║南傳巴利語三藏；漢文大藏經；藏文甘殊爾、丹殊爾。梵文佛典
ZW01na002_p0005a24║雖仍有留存，且近年來不斷有新的梵文佛典被發現，但大抵均為
ZW01na002_p0005a25║單部殘頁。雖然它的研究價值不能低估，但畢竟已不足成為完
ZW01na002_p0005a26║整的大藏。另外，中國還保存有完整的傣文大藏經、蒙文大藏
ZW01na002_p0005a27║經、滿文大藏經、出土不少殘缺不全的西夏文大藏經，但上述佛
ZW01na002_p0006a01║藏基本是從前述三種主要的佛藏轉譯的。因此，巴利語三藏、漢
ZW01na002_p0006a02║文大藏經及藏文甘殊爾、丹殊爾等三種佛藏在佛教研究中的意
ZW01na002_p0006a03║義和價值是不言自明的。
ZW01na002_p0006a04║就上述三種主要的佛藏而言，漢文大藏經所收經籍的數量
ZW01na002_p0006a05║最多，其經籍所涉及的時代跨度最大，地區涵蓋面最廣，所包容
ZW01na002_p0006a06║的佛教派別也最多。因此，巴利語及藏文佛藏固然有其不可替
ZW01na002_p0006a07║代的獨特的研究價值，漢文大藏經的價值顯然更值得人們重視。
ZW01na002_p0006a08║近代以來，西方的佛教學者大抵沿著巴利語佛典——梵文
ZW01na002_p0006a09║佛典——藏文佛典這麼一條路線來展開佛教研究，從事漢文佛
ZW01na002_p0006a10║典研究的人相對來說較少，這種情況與漢文佛典本身的價值相
ZW01na002_p0006a11║比很不相稱。所以形成這麼一種局面，除了其它種種原因外，語
ZW01na002_p0006a12║言的障礙及對漢文大藏經及其價值不甚了解，大約也是重要因
ZW01na002_p0006a13║素。現在，有的學者已開始注意到這一問題，中外都有學者在呼
ZW01na002_p0006a14║籲並從事漢文佛典的英譯工作。我深信，更多的人會越來越認
ZW01na002_p0006a15║識到漢文佛典的重要價值，從而對它展開深入的研究，而漢文大
ZW01na002_p0006a16║藏經也會在這一過程中，為人類文化的重建與發展作出它應有
ZW01na002_p0006a17║的貢獻。
ZW01na002_p0006a18║如果我們把目前還散佚在藏外的佛教文獻也儘量收集、整
ZW01na002_p0006a19║理出來，並收歸入藏，則漢文大藏經將對佛教的發展與研究、對
ZW01na002_p0006a20║人類文化作出更大的貢獻。
ZW01na002_p0006a21║這就是《藏外佛教文獻》的宗旨。願意與所有關心此事的人
ZW01na002_p0006a22║士共勉。
ZW01na002_p0006a23║
ZW01na002_p0006a24║其次介紹《藏外佛教文獻》第一輯的主要內容。
ZW01na002_p0006a25║第一輯的「敦煌禪籍」專欄刊登了四篇新發現的敦煌禪文
ZW01na002_p0006a26║獻：
ZW01na002_p0006a27║《天竺國菩提達摩禪師論》、《禪策問答》、《息諍論》依次抄寫
ZW01na002_p0007a01║在同一敦煌寫卷上。其中《禪策問答》通過三十道問答，論述了
ZW01na002_p0007a02║修禪的許多具體問題；《息諍論》則著重說明真如佛性具在心中，
ZW01na002_p0007a03║故而解不外憑，反對祇知追求經論，諍論道理的學風。它們均係
ZW01na002_p0007a04║最新發現並首次公佈。我認為它們都是北宗禪的著作，很可能
ZW01na002_p0007a05║屬於義福一系。讀者可以通過它們進一步增加對北宗禪的了
ZW01na002_p0007a06║解。《天竺國菩提達摩禪師論》託名禪宗初祖達摩，論述禪門之
ZW01na002_p0007a07║法。刊佈在這裡的是一個新發現的寫本，與保存在法國伯希和
ZW01na002_p0007a08║敦煌特藏中的同名異本相比，它的結尾部分多出一段，從而給人
ZW01na002_p0007a09║們帶來一些新的信息。
ZW01na002_p0007a10║第一輯的「密教典籍」專欄刊登印度密教文獻一篇，為《八種
ZW01na002_p0007a11║粗重犯墮》。該文獻作者不詳，託名馬鳴著，共論述密教戒律八
ZW01na002_p0007a12║條。該文獻係在西夏故地發現，對研究西夏佛教有一定的價值。
ZW01na002_p0007a13║第一輯的「三藏註疏」專欄刊登經律論疏各一篇：
ZW01na002_p0007a14║《天請問經疏》是唐代著名僧人文軌的作品。《大正藏》收入
ZW01na002_p0007a15║了該疏的一個殘本，這裡刊佈的則是一個完整的校訂本。
ZW01na002_p0007a16║《行事鈔中分門圖錄》是對唐釋道宣《四分律行事鈔》的科
ZW01na002_p0007a17║分，原卷採用圖示式，故名。刊佈時限於條件，改為提綱式。該
ZW01na002_p0007a18║文獻亦為最新發現與首次刊佈。
ZW01na002_p0007a19║《阿毗達磨俱舍論實義疏》的作者安慧是印度佛教著名的
ZW01na002_p0007a20║「十大論師」之一。該疏主要反駁眾賢《順正理論》對世親《俱舍
ZW01na002_p0007a21║論》的批評，是反映六世紀上半葉印度佛教的重要著作。這部著
ZW01na002_p0007a22║作何時、由何人譯為漢文，在我國經錄中沒有記載。《大正藏》收
ZW01na002_p0007a23║入了依據法國伯希和特藏錄文的節抄本，這裡刊佈的則是該疏
ZW01na002_p0007a24║卷三的全文。這個寫本在敦煌發現後曾經一度流散民間，後為
ZW01na002_p0007a25║北京圖書館收藏。最近我們在北圖另行收藏的敦煌遺書殘片中
ZW01na002_p0007a26║發現了這個民間流散本缺失的卷首部分，使該卷得以復原，實為
ZW01na002_p0007a27║幸事。敦煌遺書中有該《實義疏》的回鶻文譯本，兩者可以參照。
ZW01na002_p0008a01║第一輯的「疑偽經」專欄刊佈了敦煌疑偽經八篇。這些疑偽
ZW01na002_p0008a02║經大多為首次公佈。有些以前雖然也曾有人發表，但這次均根
ZW01na002_p0008a03║據諸種寫本重新校勘，或改正錯誤，或補正殘缺。應該說明，所
ZW01na002_p0008a04║謂「疑偽經」是一個很複雜的概念，其中不少經典並非如人們所
ZW01na002_p0008a05║想像的是中國人的作品。這個問題，需要在今後作專題論述。
ZW01na002_p0008a06║《佛為心王菩薩說頭陀經》是一部對禪宗有著重大影響的經
ZW01na002_p0008a07║典，關於它的作者及產生年代目前均不清楚。以前人們已經知
ZW01na002_p0008a08║道它有兩個漢文殘本與一個粟特文殘本，兩種文字的寫本內容
ZW01na002_p0008a09║互不相同。本輯刊佈的則是漢文全本，使得粟特文本有了一個
ZW01na002_p0008a10║可靠的參照本。漢文全本並附有註疏。可以預見，本文獻的刊
ZW01na002_p0008a11║佈，不但對禪宗研究，而且對粟特文研究，均會產生積極的作用。
ZW01na002_p0008a12║《佛說孝順子修行成佛經》與《最妙勝定經》被傳統經錄稱為
ZW01na002_p0008a13║疑偽經，但人們可以從本輯刊佈的經文看到，它們實際都是域外
ZW01na002_p0008a14║傳入，而非中國人撰述。《水月觀音經》反映了中國佛教的觀音
ZW01na002_p0008a15║崇拜；《金剛經纂》反映了中國佛教的經典崇拜；《大方廣華嚴十
ZW01na002_p0008a16║惡品經》則是南北朝中國佛教斷肉食素運動的產物。由於疑偽
ZW01na002_p0008a17║經多在民間流傳，缺乏整理，故容易產生諸種異本。本輯刊佈的
ZW01na002_p0008a18║《天公經》有三種異本、《佛母經》有四種異本，就反映了這方面的
ZW01na002_p0008a19║情況。
ZW01na002_p0008a20║第一輯的「研究論文」專欄發表論文一篇：
ZW01na002_p0008a21║《關於〈禪藏〉與敦煌禪籍的若干問題》認為唐宗密的確編輯
ZW01na002_p0008a22║過《禪藏》。在對《禪藏》進行考察與對敦煌禪籍現狀進行分析之
ZW01na002_p0008a23║後，文章指出宗密《禪藏》的相當一部分被保存在敦煌禪籍中，根
ZW01na002_p0008a24║據敦煌禪籍復原《禪藏》是可能的，這必將揭開禪宗研究的新篇
ZW01na002_p0008a25║章。
ZW01na002_p0008a26║
ZW01na002_p0008a27║最後是幾點希望。
ZW01na002_p0009a01║《藏外佛教文獻》是一枝剛剛抽條的幼芽，迫切希望得到如
ZW01na002_p0009a02║下各種支持：
ZW01na002_p0009a03║衷心希望讀者對我們的文獻整理工作，包括篇目的確定、底
ZW01na002_p0009a04║校本的選擇、辨字錄文、校勘註記、分段標點、題解說明等各個方
ZW01na002_p0009a05║面，提出認真的批評，以把藏外佛教文獻的整理工作做得更好。
ZW01na002_p0009a06║藏外佛教文獻散佚在各地，收集極為不易。衷心希望各界
ZW01na002_p0009a07║人士能夠提供各種尚未入藏的佛教文獻的信息與資料，無論片
ZW01na002_p0009a08║紙隻字，均不勝感謝。凡提供的底校本被採用者，一律刊佈功德
ZW01na002_p0009a09║芳名，並致酬示謝。如有投稿者，更無任歡迎。詳見《徵稿啟
ZW01na002_p0009a10║事》。
ZW01na002_p0009a11║《藏外佛教文獻》沒有經濟來源，第一輯賴中國佛教文化研

ZW01na002_p0010a02║Foreword
ZW01na002_p0010a03║
ZW01na002_p0010a04║The foreword to each volume of Buddhist Texts Not Contained
ZW01na002_p0010a05║ in the Tripitaka acts as a bridge between the editors and the
ZW01na002_p0010a06║ readers and introduces the readers to the main contents of the respective
ZW01na002_p0010a07║ volume.
ZW01na002_p0010a08║
ZW01na002_p0010a09║Let us first of all talk about what it means by Buddhist Texts
ZW01na002_p0010a10║ Not Contained in the Tripitaka.
ZW01na002_p0010a11║
ZW01na002_p0010a12║The "Collection" means the Great Collection of the Scriptures of
ZW01na002_p0010a13║ Buddhism (Fojiao Dazangjing, Tripitaka). What traditionally is
ZW01na002_p0010a14║ called "Dazangjing" means specifically the Chinese Tripitaka, including
ZW01na002_p0010a15║ the Main Collection (Zheng Zang) and the Supplementary
ZW01na002_p0010a16║ Collection (Xu Zang). It constitutes the comprehensive compilation
ZW01na002_p0010a17║ of Buddhist texts in Chinese. Although there are many kinds
ZW01na002_p0010a18║ of Chinese Tripitaka in our country, there still are many texts
ZW01na002_p0010a19║ which have something to do with Buddhism. They are found elsewhere
ZW01na002_p0010a20║ and are outside the Tripitaka. Here we find, for example:
ZW01na002_p0010a21║ all kinds of Buddhist scriptures translated in modern times from
ZW01na002_p0010a22║ Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Mongolian, etc.; a great amount of
ZW01na002_p0010a23║ Buddhist texts from the Dunhuang Scripture Cave; ancient Buddhist
ZW01na002_p0010a24║ texts which are kept in various libraries and museums and
ZW01na002_p0010a25║ have not yet been included in the Tripitakas of the various eras;
ZW01na002_p0010a26║ Buddhist materials preserved in dynastic histories, local gazetteers,
ZW01na002_p0011a01║ classified reference books and collected works of individual
ZW01na002_p0011a02║ persons; materials on stone and bronze inscriptions; Buddhist
ZW01na002_p0011a03║ works and materials of recent dates. All the above-mentioned
ZW01na002_p0011a04║ works can be called Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the
ZW01na002_p0011a05║ Tripitaka. Literature is one of the main carriers of culture, and
ZW01na002_p0011a06║ Buddhist literature is one of the main carriers of Buddhist culture.
ZW01na002_p0011a07║ The texts already contained in the collections are, of course, very
ZW01na002_p0011a08║ important; however, also the literary contributions not yet contained
ZW01na002_p0011a09║ in the Tripitaka should not be overlooked, but must be
ZW01na002_p0011a10║ carefully edited. What has to be stated clearly is, that after the
ZW01na002_p0011a11║ often repeated critical work applied to them, the quality of the
ZW01na002_p0011a12║ texts in the Main Collection of the various eras is generally rather
ZW01na002_p0011a13║ high; on the contrary, works included in the Supplementary Collection
ZW01na002_p0011a14║ are often of a rather arbitrary nature, they lack a careful
ZW01na002_p0011a15║ selection and text critical work, and often they have wrong characters.
ZW01na002_p0011a16║ Therefore, although some texts have already been included
ZW01na002_p0011a17║ in some supplementary collections, if the quality of newly discovered
ZW01na002_p0011a18║ texts is higher than that of texts already contained in the
ZW01na002_p0011a19║ Tripitaka, this should also be an objective of our editorial work.
ZW01na002_p0011a20║
ZW01na002_p0011a21║There are now three main current versions of the Buddhist
ZW01na002_p0011a22║ Canon: the Pali Canon of the southern tradition, the Chinese version
ZW01na002_p0011a23║ of the Tripitaka, and the Tibetan Kanjur and Tanjur. Some
ZW01na002_p0011a24║ Sanskrit Buddhist texts are extant, and recently there are constant
ZW01na002_p0011a25║ new discoveries of Sanskrit texts, but they are in general
ZW01na002_p0011a26║ mutilated leaves of particular units. Although their value for research
ZW01na002_p0011a27║ cannot be underestimated, they do not amount to a complete
ZW01na002_p0012a01║ Tripitaka. Furthermore, in China there still are complete
ZW01na002_p0012a02║ Tripitakas in the Dai language, in Mongolian, in Manchu, and
ZW01na002_p0012a03║ many incomplete parts of the Tripitaka in the Tangut language
ZW01na002_p0012a04║ which have been unearthed. However, the above-mentioned
ZW01na002_p0012a05║ Buddhist collections are basically all derived and translated from
ZW01na002_p0012a06║ the before-mentioned three main versions of the Buddhist collections.
ZW01na002_p0012a07║ The meaning and value for Buddhist research of the Pali
ZW01na002_p0012a08║ Tripitaka, the Chinese versions of the Tripitaka and the Tibetan
ZW01na002_p0012a09║ Kanjur and Tanjur are therefore self-evident.
ZW01na002_p0012a10║
ZW01na002_p0012a11║Talking only about the above-mentioned three main collections
ZW01na002_p0012a12║ of the Buddhist scriptures, the Chinese Tripitaka contained the
ZW01na002_p0012a13║ greatest number of scriptures, the extent of time to which the
ZW01na002_p0012a14║ texts belong is the longest, the territory they cover is the vastest,
ZW01na002_p0012a15║ the Buddhist schools they represent are the most. Therefore, although
ZW01na002_p0012a16║ the Pali Canon and the Tibetan Buddhist Canon retain
ZW01na002_p0012a17║ their irreplaceable and unique value for research, the Chinese version
ZW01na002_p0012a18║ of the Tripitaka evidently deserves men's even more
ZW01na002_p0012a19║ attention.
ZW01na002_p0012a20║
ZW01na002_p0012a21║In modern times, developing their Buddhist research, Buddhist
ZW01na002_p0012a22║ scholars in the West generally focus their attention on a sequence
ZW01na002_p0012a23║ of Pali Canon — Sanskrit Buddhist texts — Tibetan Buddhist
ZW01na002_p0012a24║ texts. Scholars devoted to research of Chinese Buddhist texts are
ZW01na002_p0012a25║ relatively few. Such a situation, compared with the value of the
ZW01na002_p0012a26║ Chinese Buddhist texts themselves, is rather unbalanced. The
ZW01na002_p0012a27║ reason for such a state, apart from many other causes, might be
ZW01na002_p0013a01║ the obstacle of the language and lack of understanding for the Chinese
ZW01na002_p0013a02║ Tripitaka and of its value. Now many scholars have begun to
ZW01na002_p0013a03║ pay attention to this problem, and there are many Chinese and
ZW01na002_p0013a04║ foreign scholars who call for and devote themselves to the translation
ZW01na002_p0013a05║ of Chinese Buddhist texts into English. I am deeply convinced
ZW01na002_p0013a06║ that many more people will come to an ever deeper understanding
ZW01na002_p0013a07║ of the value of the Chinese Buddhist texts and develop
ZW01na002_p0013a08║ penetrating research into them. And the Chinese Tripitaka will in
ZW01na002_p0013a09║ this process offer its due contribution to the reconstruction and development
ZW01na002_p0013a10║ of mankind's culture.
ZW01na002_p0013a11║
ZW01na002_p0013a12║If we endeavour to collect and edit, as far as possible, the literary
ZW01na002_p0013a13║ contributions of Buddhism which still are lying scattered outside
ZW01na002_p0013a14║ the collection of Buddhist scriptures, and if we add them to the
ZW01na002_p0013a15║ collection, the Chinese Tripitaka will in future offer an even much
ZW01na002_p0013a16║ greater contribution to the development and research of Buddhism
ZW01na002_p0013a17║ and to the culture of mankind.
ZW01na002_p0013a18║
ZW01na002_p0013a19║This, then, is the goal of Buddhist Texts Not Contained in
ZW01na002_p0013a20║ the Tripitaka. Let us editors and all who are concerned with this
ZW01na002_p0013a21║ matter encourage each other in our endeavours.
ZW01na002_p0013a22║
ZW01na002_p0013a23║Next let me introduce the main contents of the first number of
ZW01na002_p0013a24║ Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the Tripitaka.
ZW01na002_p0013a25║
ZW01na002_p0013a26║The column "Chan Texts from Dunhuang" of the first number
ZW01na002_p0013a27║ brings four newly discovered Chan texts from Dunhuang:
ZW01na002_p0014a01║ Tianzhuguo Putidamo Chanshi Lun, Chance Wenda, and
ZW01na002_p0014a02║ Xizheng Lun are copied in sequence on one roll of Dunhuang
ZW01na002_p0014a03║ writings. The Chance Wenda explains through thirty questions
ZW01na002_p0014a04║ and answers many concrete questions of Chan practice; Xizheng
ZW01na002_p0014a05║ Lun explains emphatically that the true Buddhata is within the
ZW01na002_p0014a06║ mind, and therefore cannot be understood as taking recourse to
ZW01na002_p0014a07║ what is external to it; it is opposed to a style of study which only
ZW01na002_p0014a08║ knows how to seek great knowledge of and critical inquisition into
ZW01na002_p0014a09║ truth. These texts have all been discovered quite recently and are
ZW01na002_p0014a10║ being published for the first time. I think that they are all works
ZW01na002_p0014a11║ of the Northern Chan School, most probably in the line of Yi Fu.
ZW01na002_p0014a12║ Through them the reader can advance in his understanding of the
ZW01na002_p0014a13║ Northern Chan School. Under the name of Dharma, the first patriarch
ZW01na002_p0014a14║ of the Chan School, the Tianzhuguo Putidamo Chanshi
ZW01na002_p0014a15║ Lun discusses the method of the Chan School. What is published
ZW01na002_p0014a16║ here is a newly discovered manuscript; compared with another
ZW01na002_p0014a17║ book of the same name in Pelliot's special collection of Dunhuang
ZW01na002_p0014a18║ preserved in France, its ending has another paragraph and gives
ZW01na002_p0014a19║ us some more new information.
ZW01na002_p0014a20║
ZW01na002_p0014a21║The column "Esoteric Texts" of the first number brings a text
ZW01na002_p0014a22║ from the Indian Esoteric Buddhism, the Ba Zhong Cu Zhong
ZW01na002_p0014a23║ Fan Duo. The author of this text is unknown, it is, however, ascribed
ZW01na002_p0014a24║ to Ashvagosha. It discusses eight points of the Vinaya of
ZW01na002_p0014a25║ Esoteric Buddhism. The text belongs to the ones discovered in the
ZW01na002_p0014a26║ old sites (Heicheng) of Xixia and has its value for the study of
ZW01na002_p0014a27║ Tangut Buddhism.
ZW01na002_p0015a01║
ZW01na002_p0015a02║The section "Commentaries on the Tripitaka" brings a text each
ZW01na002_p0015a03║ from commentaries to the sutras and the vinayas:
ZW01na002_p0015a04║
ZW01na002_p0015a05║Tian Qing Wen Jing Shu is a work by the famous Tang monk
ZW01na002_p0015a06║ Wengui. The Taisho Daizokyo has included a mutilated copy of
ZW01na002_p0015a07║ this commentary. Here we publish a complete and corrected copy.
ZW01na002_p0015a08║
ZW01na002_p0015a09║Xing Shi Chao Zhong Fen Men Tu Lu is an outline for the Si
ZW01na002_p0015a10║ Fen Lu Xing Shi Chao of the Tang monk Shi Daoxuan. The original
ZW01na002_p0015a11║ book had used graphical representations, which explains the
ZW01na002_p0015a12║ name. Their publication being hampered by given conditions, it is
ZW01na002_p0015a13║ changed to the form of an outline.
ZW01na002_p0015a14║
ZW01na002_p0015a15║Anhui, the author of A Pi Da Mo Ju She Lun Shi Yi Shu, is
ZW01na002_p0015a16║ one of the famous "ten great shastra masters" of Indian
ZW01na002_p0015a17║ Buddhism. In the main it is a refutation of the criticism of
ZW01na002_p0015a18║ Samghabhadra in his Shun Zheng Li Lun against Vasubandhu's
ZW01na002_p0015a19║ Abhidharma Kosa Sastra and reflects a main work of Indian
ZW01na002_p0015a20║ Buddhism of the second half of the 6th century. There is no mention
ZW01na002_p0015a21║ in the sutra catalogues of our country on the time when this
ZW01na002_p0015a22║ work was written or who translated it into Chinese. Taisho
ZW01na002_p0015a23║ Daizokyo has included a partial copy based upon Pelliot's special
ZW01na002_p0015a24║ collection. What we publish here is the complete third volume of
ZW01na002_p0015a25║ the said commentary. The present manuscript had wandered
ZW01na002_p0015a26║ around among people for a while since its discovery in Dunhuang
ZW01na002_p0015a27║ is finally kept in the Beijing Library. When lately we checked another
ZW01na002_p0016a01║ bunch of book fragments from Dunhuang at the Beijing Library,
ZW01na002_p0016a02║ we discovered the first missing part of this book, which enabled
ZW01na002_p0016a03║ us to reconstruct the original, a really lucky event. Among
ZW01na002_p0016a04║ the extant Dunhuang books there is a Uighur version of this Shi
ZW01na002_p0016a05║ Yi Shu, so that the two can be compared.
ZW01na002_p0016a06║
ZW01na002_p0016a07║In the section "Doubtful and Spurious Works" of the first number
ZW01na002_p0016a08║ are published eight doubtful and spurious works from Dunhuang.
ZW01na002_p0016a09║ Most of these doubtful and spurious works are published for the
ZW01na002_p0016a10║ first time. Although some had been published earlier by
ZW01na002_p0016a11║ somebody, this time they all have been critically revised according
ZW01na002_p0016a12║ to the various kinds of manuscripts, wrong characters have been
ZW01na002_p0016a13║ emended or lacking parts added. We must say that "Doubtful and
ZW01na002_p0016a14║ Spurious Sutras" is a very complicated concept. Many among
ZW01na002_p0016a15║ them are no products of Chinese as one might imagine. This question
ZW01na002_p0016a16║ later on has to become the subject of a special debate.
ZW01na002_p0016a17║
ZW01na002_p0016a18║Fo Wei Xin Wang Pu Sa Shuo Tou Tuo Jing is a work which
ZW01na002_p0016a19║ has had great influence on the Chan School. At the moment there
ZW01na002_p0016a20║ is no information on its author or the time of its composition. Earlier
ZW01na002_p0016a21║ we knew already that there were two mutilated Chinese and
ZW01na002_p0016a22║ one mutilated Sogdian copy, and that the contents of the
ZW01na002_p0016a23║ manuscripts in the two languages did not correspond to each
ZW01na002_p0016a24║ other. The publication in the present number is a complete Chinese
ZW01na002_p0016a25║ version which allows the Sogdian version to have a reliable
ZW01na002_p0016a26║ work for comparison. The Chinese copy has notes and commentary
ZW01na002_p0016a27║ added. It can be expected that the publication of the present
ZW01na002_p0017a01║ text will be of great use not only for the study of the Chan School, but also for study of Soghdian.
ZW01na002_p0017a02║
ZW01na002_p0017a03║Fo Shuo Xiao Shun Zi Xiu Xing Cheng Fo Jing and Zui Miao
ZW01na002_p0017a04║ Sheng Ding Jing are classified as doubtful and spurious sutras by
ZW01na002_p0017a05║ the traditional sutra catalogues. But from the texts published in
ZW01na002_p0017a06║ the present number people will see that they all have been brought
ZW01na002_p0017a07║ into China from outside and have not been written by Chinese.
ZW01na002_p0017a08║ Shui Yue Guan Yin Jing reflects the worship of Guanyin in
ZW01na002_p0017a09║ Chinese Buddhism; Jing Gang Jing Zuan reflects the worship
ZW01na002_p0017a10║ of sutras in Chinese Buddhism; the Da Fang Guang Hua Yan
ZW01na002_p0017a11║ Shi E Pin Jing is a product of the vegetarian movement of Chinese
ZW01na002_p0017a12║ Buddhism during the time of the Northern and Southern Dynasties.
ZW01na002_p0017a13║ Since doubtful and spurious works have mostly circulated
ZW01na002_p0017a14║ among the people and there was no authoritative editing, it was
ZW01na002_p0017a15║ easy for various different versions to appear. The Tian Gong
ZW01na002_p0017a16║ Jing which we publish here has three different versions, the Fo
ZW01na002_p0017a17║ Mu Jing has four different versions, which reflects the situation
ZW01na002_p0017a18║ in this regard.
ZW01na002_p0017a19║
ZW01na002_p0017a20║The section "Research Papers" brings one articles:
ZW01na002_p0017a21║
ZW01na002_p0017a22║The article "Some Problems Concerning the Chan Zang and the
ZW01na002_p0017a23║ Chan Writings from Dunhuang" assumes that the Chan Zang has
ZW01na002_p0017a24║ effectively been composed by the Tang monk Zongmi. After an
ZW01na002_p0017a25║ inquisition into the Chan Zang and an analysis of the present
ZW01na002_p0017a26║ condition of the Dunhuang Chan writings the article points out
ZW01na002_p0018a01║ that considerable part of Zongmi's Chan Zang has been preserved
ZW01na002_p0018a02║ in the Chan writings of Dunhuang and that it is possible to
ZW01na002_p0018a03║ reconstruct the Chan Zang according to the Chan Writings of
ZW01na002_p0018a04║ Dunhuang. This will certainly open a new chapter in our research
ZW01na002_p0018a05║ into Chan Buddhism.
ZW01na002_p0018a06║
ZW01na002_p0018a07║Finally some desiderata. Buddhist Texts Not Contained in the
ZW01na002_p0018a08║ Tripitaka is a tender sprout which has just sprung up and urgently
ZW01na002_p0018a09║ hopes to find such support as follows:
ZW01na002_p0018a10║
ZW01na002_p0018a11║We earnestly hope that the readers will voice honest criticism concerning
ZW01na002_p0018a12║ our editorial work, including the definition of chapter
ZW01na002_p0018a13║ headings, the choice of the master copies, discussion of
ZW01na002_p0018a14║ characters, notes on textual criticism, segmentation and punctuation,
ZW01na002_p0018a15║ explanatory notes on the background of the works, and other
ZW01na002_p0018a16║ questions. In this way the work of Buddhist texts not included
ZW01na002_p0018a17║ in the Tripitaka will be done in an even better way.
ZW01na002_p0018a18║
ZW01na002_p0018a19║Buddhist works not included in the Tripitaka are scattered everywhere,
ZW01na002_p0018a20║ and it is extremely difficult to collect them. We earnestly
ZW01na002_p0018a21║ hope that people everywhere will come up with information and
ZW01na002_p0018a22║ material on Buddhist texts which are not yet included in the Tripitaka;
ZW01na002_p0018a23║ we will be deeply grateful even for just a short note. Anyone
ZW01na002_p0018a24║ who contributes a master copy to be used will be mentioned by
ZW01na002_p0018a25║ name and receive our deepest thanks. The sincerest thanks will go
ZW01na002_p0018a26║ to anybody who will submit an article for publication. For details
ZW01na002_p0018a27║ see Guidelines on Submitting Articles.
ZW01na002_p0019a01║
ZW01na002_p0019a02║Buddhist Texts Not Included in the Tripitaka has no financial
ZW01na002_p0019a03║ resources of its own. We are very grateful to the Institute of Chinese
ZW01na002_p0019a04║ Buddhist Culture and the Zhi Lian Jing Yuan from Hong
ZW01na002_p0019a05║ Kong for their kind support to the publication of this very first
ZW01na002_p0019a06║ book. We hope that all men of insight could generously fund the
ZW01na002_p0019a07║ publication of the next number of the same book.

ZW01na002_p0020a03║
ZW01na002_p0020a04║《藏外佛教文獻》の一輯每に「卷首の語り」というのは、編
ZW01na002_p0020a05║者が讀者と連絡をとるための橋渡しであり、本輯の主な內容
ZW01na002_p0020a06║を紹介する本據でもある。
ZW01na002_p0020a07║先ず、「藏外佛教文獻」とは何であるかについて話してお
ZW01na002_p0020a08║く。
ZW01na002_p0020a09║「藏」は佛教の大藏經を指すことである。傳統の上から
ZW01na002_p0020a10║「大藏經」と呼ばれたものは、專ら漢文大藏經、中には正藏と續
ZW01na002_p0020a11║藏も含めていることを指して言うのであり、それは我が國の漢文佛教文獻の總攬てあつた。漢文大藏經の種類が多くと雖
ZW01na002_p0020a12║も佛教にかかわる文獻が散佚して、「大藏經」に收まらないも
ZW01na002_p0020a13║のが少なくない。例えば、近代以來、サンスクリツト、パーリ、
ZW01na002_p0020a14║チベツト、モンコル文など、原文から翻譯された大量の佛教典
ZW01na002_p0020a15║籍、各地の圖書館．博物館が保存されている古代の佛教典籍、
ZW01na002_p0020a16║正史．地方史志．叢書．類書．個人文集に保存された佛教典籍、
ZW01na002_p0020a17║佛教に關連する金石資料、近現代の佛教著作と資料など、これ
ZW01na002_p0020a18║らのものが未だに歷代の大藏經の中を入れていないものがた
ZW01na002_p0020a19║くさんあり、これら種種樣樣なものはすべて「藏外佛教文獻」
ZW01na002_p0020a20║と稱すべきである。文獻なるものは文化の主な載せる機關の
ZW01na002_p0020a21║一つであり、佛教文獻も佛教文化の主な載せる機關の一つで
ZW01na002_p0020a22║ある。すでに藏經にはいる典籍は固より重要だが、散逸して
ZW01na002_p0020a23║藏經以外にある文獻も忽視するわけにはいかない。真劍に整
ZW01na002_p0020a24║理を加える必要がある。說明すべきことは、歷代の正藏は悉
ZW01na002_p0020a25║く幾度も校訂をへて、概して質がより高いが、續藏の收まると
ZW01na002_p0020a26║ころの典籍は往往にしてより強い隨意的で、且つ版本の精選
ZW01na002_p0021a01║と校訂とに欠けたもので、文字の誤謬などもある。そこで、あ
ZW01na002_p0021a02║る典籍がある續藏にとりいれられたど雖も、もし新發現の傳
ZW01na002_p0021a03║
ZW01na002_p0021a04║本のほうが藏經本に比べて、更に完璧だとすれば、やつぱり整
ZW01na002_p0021a05║理の對像となるわけである。
ZW01na002_p0021a06║現在なお世界に流傳され、且つ自ら體系となる主な佛教
ZW01na002_p0021a07║大藏經は三種あり、即ち南傳パーリ三藏、漢文大藏經、チベツ
ZW01na002_p0021a08║トのガンスウールとダンスウールはそれである。サンスクリ

ZW01na002_p0021a11║いは殘葉で、その研究價值が過小視してはいけないが、畢竟す
ZW01na002_p0021a12║るに完璧の大藏となることは足ない。そして、中國はまた完

ZW01na002_p0021a14║少なからず出土した西夏文大藏經などを保存しており、もつ
ZW01na002_p0021a15║とも上述した佛藏は主に前述した三類主要な佛藏より轉譯し

ZW01na002_p0021a17║スウールとダンスウールなどの三種類の佛藏は佛教研究での
ZW01na002_p0021a18║意義と價值が言わなくても明らかである。
ZW01na002_p0021a19║上述の三種類主な佛藏について言うと、漢文大藏經が收
ZW01na002_p0021a20║錄された經典の數が最も多く、その經籍が時代を及ぼすとこ
ZW01na002_p0021a21║ろの跨る間隔も最も長く、地區を包括する幅も最も廣く、その
ZW01na002_p0021a22║うえ包括する佛教派別も最も多いわけである。從つて、パー
ZW01na002_p0021a23║リ及チベツトの佛藏は固より掛替できない獨特な研究價值を
ZW01na002_p0021a24║持つているけれども、漢文大藏經は尚更人人の重視に值する
ZW01na002_p0021a25║ことも明らかである。
ZW01na002_p0021a26║近年以來、西方の佛教學者が大抵パーリの佛典、サンスク
ZW01na002_p0021a27║リツトの佛典、チベツトの佛典というコースを沿つて研究をく
ZW01na002_p0021a28║りひろげており、專ら漢文佛典研究にたずさわる人が相對的
ZW01na002_p0022a01║に數は少ない。このような實狀では漢文佛典そのものの價值
ZW01na002_p0022a02║に比べて極めてふさわしくない。こうした局面を致すのは別
ZW01na002_p0022a03║の諸諸な原因を除く外、言葉の妨げ並び漢文大藏經とその價
ZW01na002_p0022a04║值に對してはあまりはつきりしないことも恐らく重要な因素
ZW01na002_p0022a05║であろう。今は、この問題についてある學者が注意しはじめ、
ZW01na002_p0022a06║中國も外國も漢文佛典の英譯に從事してくるように呼びかけ
ZW01na002_p0022a07║していました。更により多くの人がますます漢文佛典の重要
ZW01na002_p0022a08║價值を認識し、從つてそれに深く研究をくりひろげ、漢文大藏
ZW01na002_p0022a09║經もきつとこの過程を通じて人類文化の創り直すこととその
ZW01na002_p0022a10║發展にあり得べき貢獻を作り出すこと深く信じております。
ZW01na002_p0022a11║さしあたりもしも私たちができ得る限り散逸した藏外に
ZW01na002_p0022a12║ある佛教文獻をかき集めて整理を加え、そして大藏經にとり
ZW01na002_p0022a13║いれられるべきものを大藏經に收まらせたら、漢文大藏經は
ZW01na002_p0022a14║將に佛教の發展と研究、そして、人類文化の發展には、更に大
ZW01na002_p0022a15║いに役割を果すことになると思う。
ZW01na002_p0022a16║これは、《藏外佛教文獻》の目的であり、冀くはこのことに
ZW01na002_p0022a17║關心を持つ方と勵みあつて努力したいと願い申上げます。
ZW01na002_p0022a18║其の次、《藏外佛教文獻》第一輯の主要內容を紹介します。
ZW01na002_p0022a19║第一輯の「敦煌禪籍」の專欄には敦煌禪文獻四篇の新發現
ZW01na002_p0022a20║したものを刊行した。
ZW01na002_p0022a21║《天竺國菩提達摩禪師論》、《禪策問答》、《息諍論》などが順
ZW01na002_p0022a22║番に同じの敦煌寫卷の上にうつした。中の《禪策問答》が三十
ZW01na002_p0022a23║題の問答を通じて禪の修持についての數多くの具體的問題を
ZW01na002_p0022a24║論述し、《息諍論》では真如佛性は俱く心中にある故、外へ憑れ
ZW01na002_p0022a25║ば理解できず、經論ばかりを目ざして理論だけを追求しよう
ZW01na002_p0022a26║とする諍論の學風には反對の立場に立つ。これらは皆最新の
ZW01na002_p0022a27║發現であり、初めての刊行である。私がこれみな北宗禪の著
ZW01na002_p0023a01║作で義福の系統するものの可能性が多いと思う。讀者はこれ
ZW01na002_p0023a02║らを通じて北宗禪に對する了解を一步深められるに違いない
ZW01na002_p0023a03║と思う。《天竺國菩提達摩禪師論》は禪宗の初祖達摩の名を托
ZW01na002_p0023a04║して禪門の法を論した。ここに刊佈したものは、一つに新發
ZW01na002_p0023a05║現の寫本であり、フランスのペリオ敦煌本にある同名異本に
ZW01na002_p0023a06║比べて、終卷部分には一段の餘裕が出てくるので人人に新し
ZW01na002_p0023a07║い消息をもたらしてきたのである。
ZW01na002_p0023a08║第一輯の「密教典籍」の專欄に刊佈された印度密教文獻一
ZW01na002_p0023a09║篇は《八種粗重犯墮》である。文獻の作者は詳しからず馬鳴と
ZW01na002_p0023a10║いう名を托して書いたものをあわせて、密教戒律の八條を論
ZW01na002_p0023a11║述した。當文獻は西夏文獻であるので、西夏佛教を研究する
ZW01na002_p0023a12║のにすいぶん價值あるものと認められる。
ZW01na002_p0023a13║第一輯の「三藏註疏」專欄には經律論疏各各一篇を刊行し
ZW01na002_p0023a14║た。

ZW01na002_p0023a16║疏の一殘本が編入され、ここに刊佈したものは完全な校訂本
ZW01na002_p0023a17║の一本である。
ZW01na002_p0023a18║《行事鈔中分門圖錄》は唐代釋道宣《四分律行事鈔》の科分
ZW01na002_p0023a19║で、原卷は圖で示す格式を採用する故、そう名付けた。刊行し

ZW01na002_p0023a24║《俱舍論》を批判することに對する反駁であり、六世紀前半の
ZW01na002_p0023a25║印度佛教を反映する重要な著作であつた。いつ、だれによつ
ZW01na002_p0023a26║て漢文に譯されたのが、我が國の經錄の中に記錄していなか
ZW01na002_p0023a27║つた。《大正藏》ではペりオ敦煌本にある當疏の節錄本を揭載
ZW01na002_p0024a01║していたが、ここに刊行するのが當疏の卷三の全文である。
ZW01na002_p0024a02║敦煌文獻の中にまだ當疏のウイグル文譯本があり、兩者を參
ZW01na002_p0024a03║照すれば良い。
ZW01na002_p0024a04║第一輯の「疑偽經」專欄には敦煌疑偽經八篇を發表。これ
ZW01na002_p0024a05║らの疑偽經は初めて發表したものが多く。以前もう發表した
ZW01na002_p0024a06║ものもあるが、今回は皆諸諸の寫本の新たな校訂によるもの、
ZW01na002_p0024a07║誤謬を正したり、殘缺を補つたりした。申すべきことは、所謂
ZW01na002_p0024a08║「疑偽經」なるものは、その概念が複雜で、就中、かなりの經典
ZW01na002_p0024a09║が決して人人の想像したような中國人の作品ではない。今後
ZW01na002_p0024a10║の專著でこの問題を論述する必要がある。
ZW01na002_p0024a11║《佛為心王菩薩說頭陀經》は禪宗に對して重大な影響を有
ZW01na002_p0024a12║する經典であるが、作者と著作の作成年代が尚はつきりしな
ZW01na002_p0024a13║い。漢文殘本殘本二點とソグト殘本一點があるということは
ZW01na002_p0024a14║よく知られていつたが、今度，新しい發現の三點の全本をあわ
ZW01na002_p0024a15║せて、完全の校訂本を發表した。校訂本はソグト本をして一
ZW01na002_p0024a16║つの當になる參照本とならしめ、且つ全本に註疏もつけてあ
ZW01na002_p0024a17║る。當文獻の開行は予想すべく、禪宗研究にだけでなく、ソグ
ZW01na002_p0024a18║ト文研究に對しても積極的影響をもたらすのである。
ZW01na002_p0024a19║《佛說孝順子修行成佛經》と《最妙勝定經》が傳統的經錄に
ZW01na002_p0024a20║疑偽經と呼ばれているものであるが、人人は本輯の經文から
ZW01na002_p0024a21║も見られるように、それらもみな域外の傳入で中國人の撰述
ZW01na002_p0024a22║ではない。
ZW01na002_p0024a23║《水月觀音經》は中國佛教の觀音に對する崇拜を反映する
ZW01na002_p0024a24║ものであり、《金剛經纂》は中國佛教の經典崇拜を反映する。
ZW01na002_p0024a25║《大方廣華嚴十惡品經》では南北朝時代における中國佛教禁肉
ZW01na002_p0024a26║食素運動の產物である。疑偽經はたいてい民間で流傳したも
ZW01na002_p0024a27║の、整理に欠缺するので、諸諸の異本が出やすいこと。本輯で
ZW01na002_p0025a01║刊行した《天公經》は三種類の異本あり、《佛母經》は四種類の
ZW01na002_p0025a02║異本がある。これなどはこの方面の實情の反映である。
ZW01na002_p0025a03║第一輯の「研究論文」專欄には論文一篇を發表した。
ZW01na002_p0025a04║《〈禪藏〉と敦煌禪籍についての若干問題》では唐の宗密

ZW01na002_p0025a07║の《禪宗》はかなりの部分が敦煌禪籍の中に保存されており、
ZW01na002_p0025a08║敦煌禪籍をふまえて《禪藏》を復元しても可能であると認め
ZW01na002_p0025a09║る。これは新しい禪宗研究の篇章を世に揭示されることに違
ZW01na002_p0025a10║いない。
ZW01na002_p0025a11║最後には幾點の望みである。
ZW01na002_p0025a12║《藏外佛教文獻》は枝に萌生えばかりの芽のようなもの
ZW01na002_p0025a13║で、以下のいろいろ支持を得たいのが緊迫である。
